# (Ann-Pytorch) Predicting-Heart-Disease

This is a simple project which predicts that a person is having heart diseases or not using a custom ann model.This model is left on a point where a user can add multiple new function/features within the model or on the model to get better understanding on the existing topics and also on the new experiments.A new user which wants to experiment on the the can do comparision between various optimizers, loss functions and use advance neural network features like dropout, batch normalization and etc. 

# Data Set
The Data set is fairly simple and consist of some general features like age,sex and the important individual features by which the dependent feature abel to tell us that a person is having a heart diseases or not.
